# Web Static Project

## Task 0: Inline Styling
This project involves creating an HTML page with inline styling for a header and a footer.

- Header: Red text, height 70px, full width.
- Footer: Green text, height 60px, full width, centered horizontally and vertically, fixed at the bottom of the page.
## Task 1: Head Styling
This task involves creating an HTML page with a header and a footer styled using the `style` tag in the `head` section.

- Header: Red text, height 70px, full width.
- Footer: Green text, height 60px, full width, centered horizontally and vertically, fixed at the bottom of the page.
## Task 2: CSS Files
This task involves creating an HTML page with a header and footer styled using three separate CSS files:
- `2-common.css`: Global styles for the body.
- `2-header.css`: Styles for the header.
- `2-footer.css`: Styles for the footer.
## Task 3: Zoning Done
This task involves creating an HTML page with a header and footer styled using separate CSS files:
- `3-common.css`: Global styles for body.
- `3-header.css`: Styles for the header, including a logo aligned to the left and vertically centered.
- `3-footer.css`: Styles for the footer, with text centered vertically and horizontally, fixed at the bottom of the page.
## Task 4: Search!
This task extends the layout to include a filter section with a search button:
- The `.container` centers the content and provides spacing below the header.
- The `.filters` section contains the search button styled with `4-filters.css`.
- The search button has a background color of #FF5A5F, text in white, and adjusts its opacity when hovered.
## Task 5: More Filters
This task introduces two new filters alongside the search button:
- The `.locations` and `.amenities` divs represent the filters.
- Each filter has a title (`h3`) and subtitle (`h4`).
- Filters are styled with `5-filters.css` to align them properly and add borders.
- The search button remains aligned and functional as in the previous tasks.
## Task 6: Filters with Hover
This task introduces dropdown menus for the "States" and "Amenities" filters:
- Hovering over the filters displays a dropdown (`.popover`) with additional options.
- States dropdown includes nested cities in a two-level list.
- The `.popover` styling is applied to ensure the dropdown is visible only on hover.
- Hover behavior is managed using the CSS `:hover` selector.
## Task 7: Display Results
This task introduces a "Places" section:
- Displays a list of places as articles with titles.
- Articles are styled with padding, margin, and a border to distinguish each place.
- The `.places` section is styled to align articles horizontally or vertically depending on screen size.
- This page combines filters with hover dropdowns and a results section for seamless UI.
## Task 8: More Details
This task enhances the "Places" section by adding:
- Price by night with a distinct style positioned in the top-right corner.
- Information section containing details about guests, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
- User section displaying the owner's name in bold.
- Description section for additional text.
- The updated layout improves usability by presenting more details in a structured way.
## Task 9: Full Details
This task adds more details to the "Places" section, including:
- List of amenities with a descriptive header and no bullet points.
- List of reviews with user, date, and review content.
- Updated layout provides a complete view of a place, enhancing usability and readability.
